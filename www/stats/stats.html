<h1>E2 Statistics</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><br>Perhaps you glanced at the Statistics nodelet and wondered about
the sheer amount of nodes, writeups and users. But how come we never see
the majority of these almost 40000 noders? Did most of these people actually write
any nodes, or did they just sign up, never to return again... The content
editors and gods are doing a terrific job removing nodes that don't
withstand the test of time, but exactly <i>how many</i> of those poor
writeups do we have around here?

<p>Perhaps you visited <a href="../?node=everything%27s%20best%20users">Everything's Best
Users</a> list and gazed at the amazing number of writeups these people
have accrued. Or how about those insanely high XPs? I could hear you say: sure
that XP is not <i>all</i> from writing phenomenal writeups, so how do we
all compare this? Let me jump ahead of myself: most of those noders on
<a href="../?node=everything%27s%20best%20users">Everything's Best
Users</a> are there because they node, node and then node some
more. And we're not just talking quantity... They're there because they
node <i>a lot</i>, but first and foremost: they <i>node well</i>.

<p>But how do we know? Somewhere cruising through the nodegel is the
<i>Average Joe Noder</i>, and after some statistical analysis, we know
all about him... We know how many nodes he makes, the votes he receives
on his writeups, the XP gains, and how many times per week he changes
his underwear.

<p><i>Average Joe</i> is everyone. On Saturday September
29, 2001 <a href="../?node_id=459692">JayBonci</a> gathered ALL the node
data from the database and  crunched it down into some usable form. The data
was post-processed and analyzed by <a href="../?node_id=768243">Professor Pi</a>. For a better understanding
and a motivation of some of the parameters that are reported here,
please visit the writeups on (Median) <a href="../?node_id=939621">Node-Fu</a> and <a href="../?node_id=954232">Median Node-Fu Product</a>.

<p>Some of the data was left out from this statistical analysis:

<ul>
<li>users with zero writeups</li>
<li><a href="../?node_id=176726">Webster 1913</a></li>
<li>some noders (less than 50) whose data import was broken somehow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Level Statistics</h2>

<p>At the time of the backup, the database consisted of approximately 12400
noders with <i>one or more</i> writeups.An overwhelming majority of these
noders (82.6%) is currently at Level 1. Beyond Level 1, the percentages
drop drastically; 8.5% of the noders is Level 2, and 4.1% is in Level
3. Detailed statistics can be seen in the following bar chart.

<center><img SRC="lvlnoders.png" height=452 width=627></center>

Even though E2 has a large noderbase -- the 12400 <i>contributing</i> noders
is probably a more useful statistic than the 39000 noders that are listed
in the Statistics Nodelet -- only 17.4% of all noders with one or more
writeups eventually make it to Level 2. In other words:

<p><center><b>Everything2 retains approximately 17% of its userbase.</b></center>

<p>If we look at the total number of writeups that each Level contributes
to the nodegel, we would perhaps expect a significant share of the lower
level noders. Even though it requires a large number of nodes for (for
instance) Level 10, there are only 25 of them (or 0.2% of all contributing
noders). The following Pie-Chart shows the node-contribution per level:

<center><img SRC="lvlnodes.png" height=498 width=581></center>

The largest contribution to the nodebase is from Level 3, but the few high-level
noders contribute large numbers to the nodegel as well. Note also the Lone
Level 13'er (hmm, <a href="../?node_id=4586">who might that be</a>?), who
is single-handedly responsible for 1.3% of the nodebase.

<p>So how much XP does the average noder collect? Of course this is dependent
on what Level the noder is at. We can calculate the average number of nodes
for each level, and the average XP for the level. Since there are some
noders with very high XP from voting, blessings or otherwise, and some
noders with very low XP (the ones who <a href="../?node=E2%20Options%3A%20Declining%20vote%20XP">Decline Voting XP</a>),
a better measure of central tendency is in this case the median. The following
plot shows the average (median) XP as a function of the average number
of writeups for the Levels 1-11.

<center><img SRC="lvlXP.png" height=493 width=628></center>

The solid line with red markers indicates the XP/Level requirements for
leveling up. From the plot, we can see that the average noder meets the
XP requirements long before reaching the writeup requirement. In fact,
line indicating the average XP diverges from the XP requirement line for
higher numbers of writeups (Levels). As a result:

<p><center><b>Higher Level Noders meet XP requirements before reaching the Writeup
Requirement.</b></center>

<p>This statement seems obvious, as most noders of Level 3 and above will
tell you, but it is an important conclusion. The graphical representation
shows how much the XP requirements <i>could be</i> increased to make it
a more it a more stringent criterion for leveling up. In fact, the XP requirements
for leveling up could be increased to match the linear fit of the actual
data:

<p><center><big>XP required = 14 x (#Writeups Required)</big></center>

<p>This would lead to the following requirements for leveling up:
