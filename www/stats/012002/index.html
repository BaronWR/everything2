<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Approximately 5 months ago, I conducted a <a
href="../../?node=statistical%20analysis">statistical analysis</a> on
node and noder data. The analysis answered several questions with
respect to average writeup <a
href="../../?node=reputation">reputations</a>, <a
href="../../?node=distribution">distribution</a> of noders per level,
noder retention, etc. Over the past few months, I have received many
requests to prepare an update on these statistics. However, there was a
<em><a href="../../?node=thesis">major obstacle</a></em> holding me back
in doing this...

<p><a href="../../?node=sigh">Until now!</a>

<p><a href="../../?node_id=459692">JayBonci</a> sent me a new E2
datafile that was collected on <a href="../../?node=20%20January,%202002">20 January, 2002</a>. In this writeup, I
shall make an attempt to compare the new statistical results to the ones
that were gathered on <a href="../../?node=September%2029,%202001">September 29, 2001</a>. For further reference,
please read the following:

<ul>
<li><a href="../../?node=Everything%20Statistics%20-%20September%2029%2C%202001">Everything
Statistics - September 29, 2001 (1)</a>, <a href="../../?node=Everything%20Statistics%20-%20September%2029%2C%202001%20%282%29">(2)</a>, <a href="../../?node=Everything%20Statistics%20-%20September%2029%2C%202001%20%283%29">(3)</a></li>

<li><a href="../../stats/honor">http://everything2.com/stats/honor/</a></li><br>
<br>
</ul>

<p>Note that the previous statistical analysis was primarily conducted
to review changes in the <a href="../../?node=Voting/Experience%20System">Level Advancement
system</a>, a.k.a. the <b><a href="../../?node=Honor%20Roll">Honor Roll</a></b>. The current statistical
analysis is mainly for general interest.

<p>The statistics were collected in similar manner to those collected on
<a href="../../?node=September%2029,%202001">September 29, 2001</a>. Data for noders with zero writeups was discarded.
Also, all <a href="../../?node_id=176726">Webster 1913</a> data was discarded. As a result, the statistics
are representative for the <em>active noders</em> on E2.

<h2>Average writeup reputation per noder</h2>

The <em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a></em> (<a href="../../?node=Interquartile%20Mean">Interquartile Mean</a> writeup-reputations) of each
noder were calculated. The distribution for the average writeup
reputations is given in the following table:

<pre>

Rep.		092901		012002		092901		012002
		&#37; &lt;rep		&#37; &lt;rep		  &#37;		  &#37;

 &hellip;		  &hellip;		  &hellip;		  &hellip;		  &hellip;

<p>The data reveals that the average writeup reputation for each noder
has increased over the past months. For instance, on 09/29/01, 13.5&#37
of the noders (100-86.5) had an average node reputation of 5 or higher.
On 01/20/02, this amount was increased to 20.1&#37;. The last two
columns in the table show that the largest percentage of noders have an
average writeup reputation between 0--1. This may seem a bit surprising,
but this is probably due to a large number of noders who "try" <a href="../../?node=E2">E2</a> for
a few writeups, and quickly give up. The average noder writes at a
<em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a></em> (<a href="../../?node=Interquartile%20Mean">Interquartile Mean</a> reputation) of <b>3.06</b>; this
average was <b>2.31</b> on September 29, 2001. Apparently, the writeup
quality has improved over the last few months. Note that this average is
not directly apparent from the data in the table, due to the <a href="../../?node=skew">skew</a> in
the distribution. The lower tail of the distribution is relatively short
(no noders with <em>really</em> bad <em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a></em>), while the upper
tail of the distribution is relatively long.

<h2>Per-level data</h2>

<p>The following table shows the statistics on a <em>per-level</em> basis. The data
for <a href="../../?node=Level%201">Level 1</a> excludes noders with zero writeups. It is interesting to
note that the average <em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a></em> for each level has increased over the past
few months.

<p>Another interesting statistic is the "noder retention", which can be
expressed by the number of noders in <a
href="../../?node=Level%202">Level 2</a> and up, divided by the total
number of noders with one or more writeups. On <a
href="../../?node=September%2029,%202001">September 29, 2001</a>, the
noder retention was <b>17.4%</b>. On <a
href="../../?node=20%20January,%202002">20 January, 2002</a> the noder
retention was <b>17.9%</b>. Although there is a slight increase in noder
retention, approximately 82% of the <a
href="../../?node=Everything%20is%20a%20community">community</a> will
never node themselves past level one.

<h2>Writeup data</h2>

The following table lists the distribution of all writeups, as a
function of writeup reputation. This data shows that there are
relatively few writeups with <em>very low</em> reputations in the
database. Only 0.4% of all writeups on E2 have a reputation of -5 or
lower. At the upper end, there is a lot more spread. Approximately 90%
of the writeups have a reputation of 16 or lower. However, a writeup
with a reputation of 100 or more ranks among the top 0.1%. There are
approximately 280 writeups with a reputation over a 100.

<p>In the period <a href="../../?node=September%2029,%202001">September 29, 2001</a> - <a href="../../?node=20%20January,%202002">20 January, 2002</a>,
a net total of 7393 writeups were deleted. Most deletions occurred on
writeups with a reputation ranging from -1 to 1.

<h2>Honor Roll data</h2>

If we consider <em>only</em> the noders with 25 writeups or more (<a href="../../?node=Level%202">Level 2</a> noders, assuming they satisfy the XP conditions), 488 out of 2303
noders have a <em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a></em> of 6 or more. Thus, <b>21.2%</b> of all
<a href="../../?node=Level%202">Level 2</a> noders and up will benefit from the <a href="../../?node=Honor%20Roll">Honor Roll</a>. 

<p>On <a href="../../?node=September%2029,%202001">September 29, 2001</a>, 267 out of 2205 noders had a <em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a></em> of 6 or
more, which amounts to <b>12%</b>. The initial proposal called for a
<em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a></em> of 5 or more to enter the <a href="../../?node=Honor%20Roll">Honor Roll</a>, which would benefit
approximately <b>20%</b> at that time.

<p>In the future, the target entry level for the <a href="../../?node=Honor%20Roll">Honor Roll</a> will be
adjusted, so that approximately 20% of the <a href="../../?node=Level%202">Level 2</a> noders and up will
benefit from it. The entry level will most likely be adjusted upwards in
the near future. This should also be beneficial for noders with
<em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a>s</em> above the upper cut-off for the <a href="../../?node=Honor%20Roll">Honor Roll</a> (2 &times;
the entry value for <em><a href="../../?node=merit">merit</a></em>).

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The average writeup reputation for all noders is steadily rising. This
may be attributed to deletion of superseded writeups, better
noding and more voting noders present.

<p>Only a small amount (less than 0.4%) of the writeups has a writeup
reputation less than -5. Apparently the life-time of these type of
writeups is not very long. Poor writeups are removed before they gather
significant downvotes.

<p>From <a href="../../?node=September%2029,%202001">September 29, 2001</a> to <a href="../../?node=20%20January,%202002">20 January, 2002</a> there was a negative
growth in the number of writeups. However, this is most likely a
beneficial effect on the database. E1 writeups are consolidated,
and often one detailed writeup replaces several older writeups. The
statistics suggest that the overall quality of the site is continuously on the rise.
