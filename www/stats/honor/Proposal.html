<h2>
<a NAME="whychange"></a>Why change the Level Advancement System?</h2>
E2 is unique with respect to its wide diversity of topics that can be found:
factual knowledge, poetry, politics, science, history... Name any subject and
it is represented in some form or another. This content is added by a group
of noders with a very diverse background, culture and motivation to do
so.

<p>With this diversity comes a broad range of <i>noding styles</i>. Some noders
focus very much on <i>quantity</i>; quickly add as many nodes on a wide
variety of topics. Others take the <i>quality</i> approach: add well-researched,
in-depth writeups on a topic. Of course there is a huge group that falls
somewhere in between, and then we have the very few brilliant minds who
can crank out 5 or more masterpieces in a day. There are many approaches to
climbing the E2 ladder, but as long as the writeups are for the best of
the database, any approach is fine:
<center>
<p>"Node any way you want, as long as it is good for E2"</center>

<p>To be more concrete: I don't judge the addition of plain, non-explicated
lyrics (leaving copyright issues out of the debate), complete books from
the public domain, or <i>complete</i> and <i>maintained</i> databases (notice
the emphasis). The test of time will tell whether a contribution is worth its bytes.


<p>Now let's look at how the contribution of noders is valued: each writeup
is rewarded (or punished) with votes, the noder accumulates XP, and ultimately
gains levels. Climbing the ranks of E2 is <i>a game</i> with a fixed set
of rules called the <a href="../../?node=Voting%2FExperience%20System">Voting/Experience
System</a>. This game element is to a large extent what keeps E2 ticking:
noders are enticed to <i>add content</i> and <i>evaluate work of their
peers</i> through voting.

<p>But... not all writeups are equal. The Level Advancement system is supposed
to reward both <i>quality</i> of writeups (through the XP requirements
for leveling-up) as well as <i>quantity</i> (through the number-of writeups
requirements). And that's where the rules of the game appear to be a little outdated.
As I have showed in my recent statistics on noder data (<a href="../../stats">http://everything2.com/stats</a>),
the experienced noder reaches XP requirements for leveling up <i>much faster</i>
than the writeups-requirements. This has the following effects on the content
of the database:
<ul>

<li>"Bad" writeups are not removed or improved. Instead, they remain hidden
in the sheer volume of writeups. There is no incentive to do anything
about this, since it results in loss of a writeup, or loss of
noding-time that can be used to generate more writeups. Either way, it
doesn't help the noder to level-up. Unfortunately that's the way some
noders appear to play this game. It is quite discouraging to hit <a
href="../../?node=Random%20Node">Random Node</a> and being offered yet
another <i>vague</i>, <i>unfunny</i> or <i>uninformative</i> one-liner.
The low reputation of these writeups is offers no incentive to fix
things. The writeup stays, unless by chance an editor or a god notices
it. With 40,000 writeups, that's a hard task.</li>

<li>
<a href="../../?node=Noding%20for%20Numbers">Noding for Numbers</a>.
In words, it is highly discouraged but in practice, there is nothing to
stop a noder from adding a whole string of hidden, sub-par writeups, simply
to level-up.</li>
</ul>

E2 is continuously aiming to improve itself. "<a
href="../../?node_id=960246">Raising the Bar</a>", to quote dannye's
brilliant writeup. And he is right (isn't he always?). With this in mind
it is unfortunate that we are stuck with a Level Advancement system that
---in effect--- only rewards <i>quantity</i>, and not <i>quality</i>.
Agreed, it is <i>only a game</i>, but the rules of the game are no
longer appropriate with respect to the way we play it, or the way we are
supposed to play it. With that in mind, and with the support from many
noders (although <a href="../../?node_id=282">dem bones</a> and <a
href="../../?node_id=459692">JayBonci</a> deserve a special mention), I
investigated some improvements over the current Level Advancement
system.


<h2>
<a NAME="summarydisc"></a>Summary of Discussion</h2>
On Wednesday, October 3,  I released the <a href="../../stats">Everything Statistics</a>
document. <a href="../../?node=Everything%20Statistics%20-%20September%2029%2C%202001">The
discussion</a> on the proposed Level Advancement system generated a large
volume of valuable comments, criticism and encouragement. The proposed
system was based on two criterions that I used to characterize noder progress:
<a href="../../?node_id=939621">Median
Node Fu</a> and <a href="../../?NODE_ID=954232">Median
Node-Fu Product</a>. In hindsight, there were several serious issues that
were not addressed properly, namely:
<ul>
<li>
The median is a one-point parameter that is sensitive towards targeted
downvoting</li>

<li>
The median is restricted to integer values, and is thus not a very <i>responsive</i>
parameter.</li>

<li>
The proposed system punishes current noders; noders will drop levels</li>

<li>
Noders will change the way they write; they no longer add writeups that
don't "score" well, and they will remove writeups to improve their stats..</li>

<li>
There is no incentive to vote or otherwise improve the database, since
XP has no more function for level advancement.</li>

<li>
Is node-reputation a valid criterion to evaluate node quality?</li>
</ul>
To accommodate these valid points, I stepped away from the initial proposal,
and modified he system to a <i>reward-only</i> system; <b><a href="../../?node_id=1171698">The
Honor Roll</a></b>. Compared to the initial proposal, this system has the
following advantages:
<ul>
<li>
Every noder will remain at his/her level. No one is "punished.</li>

<li>
Noding styles are not altered. Any content counts towards level advancement,
but high-reputation content will earn level advancement more quickly</li>

<li>
XP is still required to level-up; noders are encouraged to vote or participate
otherwise</li>
</ul>
There issues with properly calculating the "average" node reputation, making
the system less prone to downvoting, were left open in the proposal, and
I will fill in those gaps in this discussion. The point of "node quality"
is of course a subjective issue, but looking at the list of noders who
will benefit from the Honor Roll, I believe that this system offers a significant
improvement over the current system.

<h2>
<a NAME="iqm"></a>The Interquartile Mean as measure of central tendency</h2>

The major problem with the median as <a
href="../../?node=Measures%20of%20Central%20Tendency">measure of central
tendency</a> is that it is a rather coarse parameter for determining an
average. This is <i>not</i> because the median by itself is inaccurate,
but because of the <i>discreteness</i> of the population; node
reputations can only assume <i>integer</i> values (..., 0, 1, 2, ....).
Since the median is the middle (value) of the distribution, it is always
an integer (for an odd number of writeups).

<p>The other problem, the sensitivity of the median towards targeted
downvoting is <i>not</i> a flaw of the median by itself, as it is meant
to describe random occurrences/treatments on a population (<i>i.e.</i>
every writeup has the same chance to be viewed/voted on). Of course,
targeted downvoting is not a random phenomenon. On the other hand, this
makes the median an unreliable parameter to obtain a noder's average
reputation, and this issue must be addressed.


<p>A more robust method to obtain an average node-reputation would incorporate
more datapoints; for instance, we could use an average of the 1st quartile,
median and 3rd quartile as estimates (such as <a href="../../?node_id=1172127">proposed</a>
by <a href="../../?node_id=977274">1010011010</a>). However, this system is
still prone to targeted downvoting around those three points.

<p>To obtain more robustness, we need to incorporate even more datapoints.
Yerricde's <a href="../../?node_id=1171171">proposal</a> to use the <a href="../../?node_id=1174972">Interquartile
Mean</a> (IQM) proved to be the most promising. I also investigated
the <a href="../../?NODE="Interdecile%20mean">Interdecile Mean</a>, but
hopefully the following plot will make it clear why this measure (or even
wider ranges, up to the geometric mean) are less appropriate as a measure
of central tendency.

<p>The following plot shows why the writeup-reputation distribution for
ALL the writeups in the database, in cumulative form (e.g. approximately
50% of all the writeups has a reputation 4 or lower).
<center><img SRC="rephistogram.png" height=594 width=778></center>

<p>The black line indicates the range of the Interquartile Mean (it goes through
the 25% and 75% values for writeup reputation). The red line indicates
the range for the Interdecile Mean (10% and 90% values for writeup reputation).
The area between the actual curve and the lines is a measure for the skewness
of the range that we are sampling. In the case of a <i>symmetric</i> distribution,
the IQM and IDM lines would go through the point of inflection, and in
this case you would have a "positive" and a "negative" area, together equaling
to zero. As can be seen , <i>node reputation is not symmetrically distributed</i>.

<p>But more importantly, there are fewer datapoints at the extremes of
the plot (<i>i.e.</i> low and high reputation). As a result, the accuracy
of these values is less; there is greater <i>confidence</i> in the value of the
quartiles than the deciles. Now visualize the area
that is enclosed by the line for the interquartile mean and the reputation-curve.
Slide the quartile points over a little, and the enclosed area will change
its value slightly. Now do the same thing with the area enclosed by the
decile points; a small change in the value of the deciles significantly
changes size of the enclosed area. You can also draw a line going
through the begin and endpoints, representing the geometric mean, and you
will see the drastic effect of peak skewness.

<p>In words, the inaccuracy of the endpoints significantly affects the
amount of skewness that is incorporated in the average. As a result, the
<i>Interquartile Mean</i> is a more appropriate measure of central
tendency for this distribution. Since we are using exactly 50% of all
the writeup-reputations, the Interquartile Mean is also relatively
stable with respect to mass downvoting.

<p>The IQM for ALL noders can be seen in the following histogram:
<center><img SRC="IQMhist.png" height=509 width=669></center>
The distribution of IQM for all noders shows a much better symmetry and
continuity than the histogram for MNF (see <a href="../../stats">Everything
Statistics</a>). This is mostly due to the higher responsiveness of the
IQM, as compared to the median. This high degree of symmetry further suggests
that the IQM is a stable and unbiased measure of central tendency for the
node reputation distributions that we encounter. The slight upward skew
of the distribution is to be expected, since low-reputation writeups are more prone to removal).
The mean reputation=2.31 (with a standard deviation=3.88).
<p>The following graph shows the data in a cumulative form:
<center><img SRC="IQMhistcumul.png" height=495 width=642></center>
This plot is convenient to estimate the entry level for the Honor Roll.
<i>E.g.</i> if we set the entry level at IQM>=3, 29% of ALL noders with 1 or more writeups
will benefit from the Honor Roll system (that is, if they have at least
25 writeups and meet the XP requirements).

<a NAME="honorroll"></a>The Honor Roll</h2>
<a href="../../?node=Everything%20Statistics%20-%20September%2029%2C%202001%20%282%29">Everything

of the Honor Roll system. The figures that were stated were initial <i>guesstimates</i>
of the <b>entry level,</b> <b>IQM cap </b>and <b>IQMP </b>requirements

I adjusted the figures to more appropriate values.

<ul>
<li>
<i>Every</i> noder advances after meeting the XP and WU requirements (second
and third columns).</li>

<li>
The [Honor Roll] - Noders can advance levels with fewer writeups if they
meet the following requirements:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Meet the regular XP requirements.</li>

<li>
Obtained Level 2 through the Regular Requirements.</li>

<li>
Obtain an Interquartile Mean node-reputation (IQM) of 5 or more.</li>
</ul>

<li>
Level advancement in the Honor Roll goes according to IQMP; the product
of the IQM and the number of writeups.</li>

<li>
Noders in the Honor Roll with an IQM>=10 will advance as if they have an
IQM=10 (A "cap" on IQM)</li>
</ul>

The requirements of the Honor Roll are set up as follows. The IQMP
requirements in the Honor Roll were set to 5 times the number of
writeups required, since 5 is the IQM entry level for the Honor Roll. As
a result, a noder with an IQM=5 (exactly), will advance through the
levels according to the Regular Requirements. Noders with a higher
average node reputation (IQM) than 5 will require fewer writeups to
level up. E.g., a noder at IQM=8 needs to meet only 5/8 = 62.5% of the
Regular writeup requirements.

<p>The cap on the IQM is set at twice IQM value for the entry level. This
assures that a noder must node at least half of the writeups required for
leveling up according to the Regular requirements (5/10 = 50%).

<p>The XP requirements <i>always</i> apply for leveling up; <i>e.g</i>.
a noder with IQM=7 and 500 writeups (IQMP=3500) <i>must</i> have
at least 2900 XP to advance to Level 8. This rule encourages voting participation.

<p>The entry level, and cap can easily be adjusted in the future. This
may be necessary when vote-inflation becomes an issue (more noders will
input more votes to the system), or the average quality of the writeups
significantly improves (that's the ultimate goal of this system...)

<p align=center><b>Noders following the Regular requirements will NEVER drop any levels.
Noders in the Honor Roll <i>may level down </i>when we raise the Honor
Roll entry level in the future. </b>

<p>The Honor Roll is a <i>reward</i> for
high quality noding that must be earned. Noders entering the Honor Roll
should be aware that we will <a href="../../?node_id=960246">keep raising
the bar</a>.

<p>The following table shows how much the Writeup requirements drop in
the Honor System, with an Entry level IQM=5 and a cap IQM>=10. Noders
with fractional IQM values will require a number of writeups somewhere
between the lower and higher IQM values listed in the table.

<p><h2><a NAME="implication"></a>Implications of the Honor Roll</h2>

For now, I have set the entry level of the Honor Roll at IQM=5 and a cap
at IQM=10. These values could still be adjusted. Several noders will immediately
encounter a level gain after implementation of the system. I have investigated
the impact of setting the IQM entry level at IQM= 3, 4, 4.5, 5, and
6 (with a cap always 2x the entry level IQMP). Lower IQM entry levels are
undesired, because the Honor Roll entry would fall below the average IQMP
of all noders. Higher IQM entry levels are undesired, since the threshold
would be too high for many noders.

<p><b>It is important to set the IQM entry level <i>not too high</i>, because
we want to encourage as many noders as possible to enter the Honor Roll,
and improve their writeups.</b>

<p>How does that work out in numbers? The following table shows how many
noders would benefit from the Honor Roll, based on their IQM and number
of writeups:

<p>Total number of noders with 25 or more writeups: <b>2205 </b>(eligible
for entering Honor Roll)

<p>The most important conclusion from this data comes from the bottom
row. If we select an IQM=5 entry level, approximately 20% of all the
noders with 25 writeups or more will fall into the Honor Roll system,
and see a <i>direct benefit</i>, either by reduced number of writeups
required to level-up or by direct leveling up. Alternatively, IQM entry
levels 4 or 4.5 would be acceptable. For higher entry levels, very few
noders would see benefits of the system. At IQM=3 too many noders would
level up too quickly.

<center>
<p><b>My recommendation is to set an IQM=5 entry level, and a cap at IQM=10.</b></center>

<p><br>"Live" calculation of the Interquartile Mean is too computationally 
intensive, since it requires collecting of <i>all</i> the node reputation data
for a certain noder. This cannot be done with adding one or two simple counters
(as would be the case with the geometric mean), since the Interquartile
range is partially based on the <i>rank</i> of the writeup reputations.

<p>We can calculate IQM every night during database backup. The IQM will
assume a fixed value for one day. This has the benefit that adding a new
writeup does not show a direct drop in IQM (with possible loss of a Level).
<p>The first step in calculating IQM is obtaining the data. JayBonci has
timed this process, and it should not take more than 5 minutes. The second
step is the actual calculation of IQM. I have devised a fast method to
calculate IQM that only requires reading the reputation data once. A sorting
routine would be much, much slower...

<p>The algorithm places the node reputations in bins, from the lowest to
the highest reputation. From this data, the IQM can be calculated very
quickly. The method works since writeup reputations can only assume integer
values, and thus the bin values are not range values, but the actual node
reputations. The algorithm can be found here: <a href="IQMCalc.txt">IQMCalc.txt</a>.

<p><b>Disclaimer: I am NOT a programmer, so cut me some slack for not using
a "real" programming language, and for the other quirky things that could
possibly be improved in the code... DO let me know when you suspect there
is a bug in my calculation method.</b>

<p>Applying the level-up criterion and calculating the IQMP from a fixed
daily IQM value should be very simple.

<p>I suggest a step-wise implementation of the Honor Roll System. For each
step we should check what the effects are on the database, with respect
to lag.
<ol>
<li>Implement the code that retrieves node data during backup.</li>

<li>Calculation of the IQM for all noders. This should first be done in
the background, so that we can check the output before we release it
onto the masses. The IQM calculation must be absolutely foul-proof.</li>

<li>Implement IQM reporting on homenodes. Let noders get a "feel" for the numbers,
and the effect of adding writeups on their IQM.</li>

<li>In the background, calculate level gains for noders (without actually processing
the level-ups).</li>

<li>Implement the full Honor Roll system, with level-ups for noders that qualify</li>
