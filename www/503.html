<p>We are negotiating the end of some industrial action by the Everything Hamsters but they drive a tough bargain. Please wait a few minutes while we apply a stimulus package and try again.<br>
<p>If the error persists for more than a few minutes, you can share in our misery or get more information (should we have any to share) on <a href='http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=everything2'>the IRC channel</a> that our techs are often found on (also available by pointing an IRC client to irc.freenode.net:7000, channel #everything2).</p>
