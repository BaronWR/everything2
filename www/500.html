<p>Occasionally, [EDB] swallows the database handle, and it takes a couple of
minutes to fish it out from his borg-belly.  The site will come back up very soon.
<p>If it doesn't in 4-5 minutes, you should email <a href=mailto:nate@blockstackers.com>nate@blockstackers.com</a>, and I'll take care of it.
