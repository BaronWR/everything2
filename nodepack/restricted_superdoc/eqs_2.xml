  <doctext>&quot;[Depravity] is not very easily overcome.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Samuel Johnson], to James Boswell&quot;,

&quot;If you see something, or heard a sound, there you have [everything], 

just as it is.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[S. Suzuki Roshi]&quot;,

&quot;So it is with people: first let them do what they want, and watch 

them. This is the best policy. To ignore them is not good; that is the 

worst policy. The second worst is trying to control them. The best one 

is to watch them, just to watch them, without trying to control them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[S. Suzuki Roshi]&quot;,

&quot;Each portion of matter may be concieved of as a garden full of plants, 

and as a pond full os fishes. But each branch of the plant, each member 

of the animal, each drop of its humors, is also such a garden or such a 

pond.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[G.W. Leibinz]&quot;,

&quot;I like [reality]. It tastes of bread.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Jean Anouilh]&quot;,

&quot;There is no pleasure in having [nothing to do]. The pleasure is in 

having lots to do and not doing it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[John W. Raper]&quot;,

&quot;Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. 

The latter cannot understand when a man does not thoughtlessly submit 

to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his 

intelligence.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Albert Einstein]&quot;,

&quot;[I like cats] is not the right place to talk about why you don't like 

cats. Similarly, most [political node]s are full of argumentative 

writeups talking about the exact OPPOSITE of what the node is 

ostensibly about. [Present your views, don't defend them]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Pseudo_Intellectual], [Chatterbox]&quot;,

&quot;[Pride] was my wilderness, and the demon that led me there was [fear]. 

I was alone, never anything else, and never free, for I carried my 

chains within me, and they spread out from me and shackled all I 

touched.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Margaret Lawrence]&quot;,

&quot;I got to the microphone at a [graduation ceremony] and I looked out 

over that multitude of faces, and I said something to the effect of:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;You are about to be told one more time that you are America's 

most valuable [natural resource].
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Have you seen what they do to valuable natural resources?
&lt;br&gt;Have you seen a [strip mine]?
&lt;br&gt;Have you seen a clearcut in the forest?
&lt;br&gt;Have you seen a polluted river?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Don't ever let them call you a valuable natural resource.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Utah Phillips]&quot;,

&quot;I am free of all prejudices. I hate everyone equally.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[W.C. Fields]&quot;,

&quot;I can resist everything except [temptation].
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Oscar Wilde]&quot;,

&quot;I don't want to achieve [immortality] through my work. I want to 

achieve it through not dying.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Woody Allen]&quot;,

&quot;I will lash out dancing like a madman when you're gone
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Soul Coughing], [Mr. Bitterness]&quot;,

&quot;Those who [dream] by day are cognizant of many things which escape 

those who dream only by night.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Edgar Allan Poe]&quot;,

&quot;Never let your sense of [morals] get in the way of doing what's right.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Isaac Asimov]&quot;,

&quot;The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new 

discoveries, is not &lt;i&gt;[Eureka]!&lt;/i&gt; but &lt;i&gt;That's 

funny&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Isaac Asimov]&quot;,

&quot;I love [deadlines]. I love the whooshing sound they make as they fly 

by.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Douglas Adams]&quot;,

&quot;[Humor] is just another defense against the universe.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Mel Brooks]&quot;,

&quot;A life of [reaction] is a life of slavery, intellectually and 

spiritually. One must fight for a life of [action], not reaction.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Rita Mae Brown]&quot;,

&quot;To [read] without reflecting is like eating without digesting.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Edmund Burke]&quot;,

&quot;[Character] contributes to [beauty]. It fortifies a woman as her youth 

fades. A mode of conduct, a standard of [courage], discipline, 

[fortitude] and [integrity] can do a great deal to make a woman 

beautiful.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[Jacqueline Bisset]&quot;,

&quot;The only completely [consistent] people are the dead.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Aldous Huxley]&quot;,

&quot;Being [powerful] is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you 

are, you aren't.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Margaret Thatcher]&quot;,

&quot;America is the only nation in history which miraculously has gone 

directly from [barbarism] to [degeneration] without the usual interval 

of [civilization].
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Georges Clemenceau]&quot;,

&quot;[The meaning of life] is that it stops.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Franz Kafka]&quot;,

&quot;I myself have never been able to find out precisely what a [feminist] 

is, I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express 

sentiments that differentiate me from a [doormat].
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;Br&gt;--[Rebecca West]&quot;,

&quot;I am the modern, intelligent, [independent]-type woman. In other 

words, a girl who can not get a man.
&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Shelley Winters]&quot;,

&quot;Serious people have few ideas. People with ideas are never serious.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Paul Val&#233;ry]&quot;,

&quot;Half the American population no longer reads [newspaper]s: plainly, 

they are the clever half.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Gore Vidal]&quot;,

&quot;[Politics] is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack 

a passion for living it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Tom Robbins]&quot;,

&quot;Kill one man and you are a [murderer]. Kill millions and you are a 

[conqueror]. Kill everyone and you are [God].
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Jean Rostand]&quot;,

&quot;My advice is to look out for [engineers]. They begin with [sewing 

machine]s and end up with [nuclear bomb]s.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Marcel Pagnol]&quot;,

&quot;If you don't even give a thought to the wackos on the streets that go 

around saying they are god, why on earth would you believe some guy who 

went around saying it two thousand years ago?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;(unknown)&quot;,

&quot;There ain't no [devil], there's just [God] when he's drunk.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Tom Waits]&quot;,

&quot;A good [Traveler] has no fixed plans and is not intent on arriving.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Lao Tzu]&quot;,

&quot;If God had meant for us not to fly, he wouldn't have given us 

[marijuana].
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Patrick Marlowe]&quot;,

&quot;Most of the [shadow]s of life come from your own self blocking the 

sun.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[James Pickett]&quot;,

&quot;A good garden may have some [weed]s.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Thomas Fuller]&quot;,

&quot;Telling computer guys that they need to have [permission] to [please 

attribute anything you quote|quote things] is like having to tell 

little children about Death.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Ted Nelson]&quot;,

&quot;One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined 

well.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Virginia Woolf]&quot;,

&quot;A long life may not be good enough, but a [good life] is long enough.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Benjamin Franklin]&quot;,

&quot;The ones who don't [do something|do anything] are always the ones who 

try to pull you down.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Henry Rollins]&quot;,

&quot;Among modern occupations, only cult leaders and TV weathermen rival 

the technological [visionary]'s ability to retain [credibility] despite 

all evidence to the contrary.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Nathan Myhrvold]&quot;,

&quot;I'm not [confused], I'm well mixed.
&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;--[Robert Frost]&quot;,

&quot;Those who have not tasted the [bitter]est of life's bitters can never 

appreciate the sweetest of life's [sweet]s.
