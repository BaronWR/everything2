-----=====######=====-----&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



two young men on a rooftop&lt;br&gt;
of [sun] and [shingle] [tar]&lt;br&gt;
below a [kitten] curls up&lt;br&gt;
by a [baby in a jar]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;remember back in [high school] days&lt;br&gt;
when [everything] made sense&lt;br&gt;
when we only spoke of things to come&lt;br&gt;
and thought in [future tense]?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;i [remember] all these things &lt;br&gt;
but [memory is a fool]&lt;br&gt;
now i just let those days slide by&lt;br&gt;
and try to [play it cool]&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

two young men in the [basement]&lt;br&gt;
watching [lights] shift on the walls&lt;br&gt;
old [ghosts] haunt the rooms above&lt;br&gt;
while through floor vents [music falls]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;everything is changing&lt;br&gt;
from one minute to the next&lt;br&gt;
i suppose they will [forever]&lt;br&gt;
but i'm not taking any bets&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;we're [pirates] of our destiny&lt;br&gt;
and eminent is change&lt;br&gt;
but we're the only ones at fault&lt;br&gt;
for making life so [strange]&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

two young men and a shovel&lt;br&gt;
walking down the beach&lt;br&gt;
one [killing] and one [burying]&lt;br&gt;
every living thing in reach&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;[i never thought it'd be like this]&lt;br&gt;
[death] on a sunny day&lt;br&gt;
but look what we've now come to&lt;br&gt;
and the silly games we play&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;every man is thought a [fool]&lt;br&gt;
before he rounds the bend&lt;br&gt;
but every man is [wiser]&lt;br&gt;
at the journey's end&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

two young men on a gravel dock&lt;br&gt;
in the middle of the [night]&lt;br&gt;
watching water lap the [shoreline]&lt;br&gt;
and the dancing city lights&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;my life's become a [fairytale]&lt;br&gt;
i've been thinking all in [rhyme]&lt;br&gt;
of a world of [truckstop hairdressers]&lt;br&gt;
where art is considered crime&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;[art is crime] and [pain is truth]&lt;br&gt;
and the bottom is the top&lt;br&gt;
and these things are not only true&lt;br&gt;
where hairdressers work truckstops&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

two young men on a mountain&lt;br&gt;
how much better can it get&lt;br&gt;
two young men on a [railroad] [bridge]&lt;br&gt;
&quot;[are we tripping yet?]&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

two young men perform [miracles]&lt;br&gt;
in a [fantastic], made-up world&lt;br&gt;
two young men chasing [candy],&lt;br&gt;
[cigarettes] and [girls]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
two young men working overtime&lt;br&gt;
living young men's dreams&lt;br&gt;
two young men do the best they can&lt;br&gt;
in a world where [nothing's as it seems]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


We never said it was [easy], never said it was [fun]&lt;br&gt;
when the party is all over and the [damage] is all done&lt;br&gt;
[we tried to tell you] but never got through&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;do as we say and not as we do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
we warned of the [poison] hidden in the cup&lt;br&gt;
paging through the phone book and looking old friends up&lt;br&gt;
we said that being [lonely] is better than [alone]&lt;br&gt;
it's useless to look back now, [you never can go home]&lt;br&gt;
we spoke to you of all these things but [listen] you did not&lt;br&gt;
now in the [mirror] we'll remind you and in your [dreams] these thoughts
will [rot].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
