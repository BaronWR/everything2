&quot;the winter evening settles down&quot;

i have already seen measures taken
to insure the failing seasons, falling
houses and dwindling continents
&quot;we would see a sign&quot;  a story then
i will tell you a story
my children have grown and left
me with checks and letters in my mailbox
my teeth are fallen out, my thoughts
run unchecked off my tongue, i've no
strength in the mornings
i am tired of all the daytimes and
my silences are spoken of in hallways
i've no concentration or color left
i can't stand my own mind and
feel lost when i'm not alone
i am always alone
but in the early afternoons i go for long walks
to the fields outside my neighborhood
potatoes grow there, and currants
i wait there, sometimes, to see what will happen
and that is the story i will tell 

when i was twelve years old i was a young man
(i am not so young now)
you say &quot;we were all young at that age&quot;
but it isn't so, you know that it is not so
regardless, when i was twelve i sat
in this field in the afternoon
as i do everyday--as i did today
i sat and watched
and on this day something happened...


(now the story shall spin the poem--you will see)

on this day--three weeks from my thirteenth birthday--
just as the evening breeze began to pick up
