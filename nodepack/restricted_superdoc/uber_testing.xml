&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;
In addition to [weightlessness], g loads, air, water, and food supply, isolation, and [meteoroid|meteoroids], the problems of space flight included protecting the [passenger] from different kinds of [electromagnetic radiation] found above the [atmosphere]. Of the varieties of radiations in space the most mysterious is [cosmic radiation], the source of which presents one of the grandest puzzles in nuclear [astrophysics]. Some of this radiation possibly comes from the [Sun], but the preponderance of the [cosmic rays] bombarding Earth's atmosphere evidently originates outside the [solar system] - thus the term &quot;cosmic&quot; radiation. High-energy cosmic ray [primaries] - [subatomic particles], of which about 90 percent are protons of [hydrogen] and [helium] - slam into the atmosphere at velocities approaching the speed of light. Fifteen to 25 miles above Earth, the cosmic ray primaries collide with atoms and molecules in the thickening atmosphere, are broken up, and are converted into lower-energy rays called [secondaries]. Above 25 miles the atmosphere becomes too thin to absorb the cosmic ray primaries; since they are capable of penetrating a thick lead wall, it was futile to try to [shield] a spacecraft pilot completely. So in the early 1950s medical researchers, assuming that a space [pilot] would be exposed to some cosmic radiation, approached the problem primarily from the angle of establishing how large a dose a human being could [tolerate].&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

As with weightlessness and g-load research, the best [postwar] device for studying cosmic radiation was the instrumented sounding [rocket]. But the last of the rocket experiments with [primate|primates] occurred in May 1952. From that time until animal rocket shots resumed in 1958, the only upper-atmospheric research rockets fired in the country were occasional [Aerobee|Aerobees], launched by the Air Force to altitudes of about 150 miles.&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt; These shots, carrying only instruments, brought back a [modicum] of data on cosmic rays. The prime instrument for cosmic ray &lt;small&gt;&amp;#91;50&amp;#93;&lt;/small&gt; research from 1952 to 1958 was the oldest vehicle for human flight, the [balloon]. The postwar development of sturdier, larger, [polyethylene] balloons to replace rubber [aerostat|aerostats] made possible higher and higher ascents with increasingly heavier loads. At the same time the expansion of balloon technology, leading to an increasing number of giant, shiny spheres floating over the United States, multiplied reports of and popular interest in &quot;[Unidentified Flying Objects].&quot;&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In the balloon-borne space radiation experiments of the fifties, the Navy carried out some notable manned ascents into the [stratosphere]. On November 8, 1956, for example, Lieutenant Commanders Malcolm D. Ross and M. L. Lewis, as part of the Navy's Strato-Lab program of manned ascents from northern latitudes, reached 76,000 feet, then an [altitude] record. Less than a year later Ross and Lewis sat in their cramped sealed [gondola] as their huge polyethylene balloon ascended to nearly 86,000 feet. And in late June 1958 the same two Navy aerostation veterans remained in the 70,000-80,000-foot region for almost 35 hours.&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The Navy also pioneered in the use of balloon-launched rockets ([rockoon|rockoons]). The first successful rockoon launch occurred in August 1952 when, from a ship off the coast of [Greenland], a [University of Iowa] team headed by physicist [James Van Allen|James A. Van Allen] sent up a balloon from which a rocket ignited at 70,000 feet and climbed to an altitude of nearly 40 miles. The Navy did most of its upper-atmospheric research, however, with instrumented balloon flights carrying small [organism|organisms] and insects. In May 1954, for example, [General Mills], Incorporated, under contract to the Office of Naval Research, launched a polyethylene balloon, with a capacity of 3 million cubic feet, that carried cosmic ray [emulsion|emulsions] - plates designed for recording the tracks of ionizing particles - to an altitude of 115,000 feet. Five years later, from [Sioux Falls], South Dakota, [Raven Industries] launched an Office of Naval Research balloon biological package to a record altitude of 148,000 feet.&lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The center of Air Force balloon research in the early 1950s was the Aeromedical Field Laboratory in [New Mexico]. From July 21, 1950, when Air Force personnel launched the first polyethylene balloon at [Holloman Air Force Base], to December 18, 1958, the scientists at the field laboratory sent up 1000 [research balloon|research balloons], although only a small number of these ascents were designed expressly for cosmic ray study. In 1953 the Holloman researchers moved most of their balloon experiments to the northern United States, in the higher [geomagnetic] latitudes, where they could obtain increased exposure to cosmic ray primaries. During the next year they sent aloft a collection of [radish] seeds on a series of flights, compiling some 251 hours of [exposure] of the seeds above 80,000 feet. Monkeys, mice, rats, hamsters, and rabbits also drifted upward in balloons launched by [Winzen Research], Incorporated, as a Holloman contractor, from [Sault Ste. Marie, MI|Sault Ste. Marie], Michigan. The most interesting effect observed among the various test subjects was a striking increase in the number of [gray hair|gray hairs] on black mice exposed to the high altitudes.&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The first solo manned [ascent] into the stratosphere was also principally an undertaking &lt;small&gt;&amp;#91;51&amp;#93;&lt;/small&gt; of the field laboratory at Holloman. In 1956 field laboratory experimenters inaugurated [Project Manhigh], a series of flights from northern sites using Winzen balloons, to test man's ability to live for prolonged periods in a sealed-cabin environment like that inside a [spacecraft] and to gather new data on cosmic radiation. David Simons, head of the Space Biology Branch at Holloman, was project officer for the Manhigh ascents. The initial flight, from [Fleming Field], Minnesota, took place on June 2, 1957. Captain Joseph W. Kittinger stayed aloft inside his sealed gondola for nearly seven hours, breathing pure [oxygen], making visual observations, and talking frequently with John P. Stapp, the flight [surgeon], and other physicians on the ground. Kittinger spent two hours above 92,000 feet; his maximum altitude during the flight was 96,000 feet.&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

About nine weeks later Simons himself entered the [space equivalent region], suspended in a sealed [capsule] below a 3-million-cubic-foot polyethylene balloon launched from an open-face mine near [Crosby, MN|Crosby], Minnesota. Simons exceeded Kittinger's mark for both duration and altitude, staying [aloft] 32 hours and remaining at 101,000 feet for about 5 hours. Simons was the first man in history to see the Sun set and then rise again from the edge of space. In the &lt;i&gt;[Manhigh I] &lt;/i&gt;gondola he spent more time than anyone before him looking upward at the [blackness] of space and outward at the white and blue layers of the atmosphere. &quot;The capsule seemed like a welcome window permitting a fabulous [view] and precious opportunities, not a prison or an enclosure,&quot; he related after the flight.&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In October 1958 an excessive [temperature] rise in the capsule forced a premature [termination] of the third Manhigh flight, carrying Lieutenant Clifton M. McClure.&lt;sup&gt;62&lt;/sup&gt; Yet McClure's ascent, together with those of Kittinger and Simons, proved the [workability] of the sealed cabin for sustaining human life where &quot;the environment is as [hostile] and very nearly as different in appearance as one would expect to observe from a [satellite].&quot;&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; The environmental control system of the Manhigh capsule and the instrumentation for physiological [telemetering] were strikingly similar to those later used in the [Mercury Project|Mercury] spacecraft.&lt;p&gt;

With regard to cosmic [radiation], however, the Manhigh flights, like numerous rocket, balloon, and laboratory experiments of previous and succeeding years, returned data that were either negative or [inconclusive]. During the &lt;i&gt;Manhigh II &lt;/i&gt;ascent two containers of bread [mold] were attached to the underside of the capsule, and Simons wore emulsion plates on his arms and chest to measure cosmic ray penetration. The plates did show indications of several hits by so-called &quot;[heavy]&quot; primaries - cosmic ray particles made up of nuclear particles heavier than are found in hydrogen or helium - but years later the skin in the area of the plates revealed no effects of radiation.&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

All these experiments left most scientists as [reluctant] to speculate about the hazards from cosmic rays in flight as they had been in the early fifties. Simons felt that in manned [orbital] flights following roughly [equatorial] orbits, where the spacecraft remained within the protective shielding of Earth's [magnetic field|magnetic fields], the spacecraft pilot would be in no danger from cosmic radiation. Yet he remained &lt;small&gt;&amp;#91;52&amp;#93;&lt;/small&gt; troubled by the possibility that a [solar flare], a sudden burst of energy from the Sun, might precipitate a great increase in cosmic ray intensity during a [space mission]. About a twentyfold multiplication of cosmic radiation accompanied a solar flare of February 1956. Simons' concern with solar flares led him to the conclusion that continuous [voice] contact between ground stations and the space pilot would be essential, as well as stepped-up efforts to predict the flares.&lt;sup&gt;65&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

All proponents of manned space flight were alarmed when information transmitted from the first three [Explorer] satellites, launched during the first half of 1958, disclosed the existence of a huge envelope of radiation beyond the ionosphere. Evidently consisting of protons and electrons trapped in Earth's magnetic field, the radiation layer begins about 400 miles out in space and doubles in intensity about every 60 miles before tapering away about 1200 miles from Earth. This discovery was the first &quot;[Van Allen belts|Van Allen belt],&quot; named after James A. Van Allen, United States director of the [International Geophysical Year] radiation experiments. The &lt;i&gt;[Pioneer III] &lt;/i&gt;probe, launched in December 1958, failed to reach [escape velocity], but it did reveal that the radiation zone consisted not of one belt but of two at least - an inner belt of high-energy particles and an outer belt of less energetic particles. Two earlier Pioneer shots, in October and November, had shown that while the radiation zone was several thousand miles deep, it did not extend into space [indefinitely].&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt; Quite obviously, the doughnut-shaped Van Allen belts would pose a serious threat for manned travel in high orbits or [interplanetary] voyages. In the early manned ventures into space, however, a spacecraft could be placed in an orbit 100 to 150 miles from Earth, high enough to be free of atmospheric frictional [drag], yet low enough to stay underthe Van Allen radiation.&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The radiation hazards of space flight also include [solar radiation]. Solar heat, [ultraviolet] rays, and [x-ray|x-rays] all become much more intense beyond the diffusive atmosphere of Earth, but they can be adequately counteracted by space cabin [insulation], shielding, [refractive] paint, and other techniques. Advanced space missions may subject astronauts to dangers from other kinds of radiation, such as the radiation belts surrounding other planets or the radioactivity produced by a spacecraft with a [nuclear] powerplant.&lt;sup&gt;68
