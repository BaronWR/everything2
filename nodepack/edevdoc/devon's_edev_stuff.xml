  <doctext>Gotta start getting my thoughts down, off the notebook paper, and into a realistic format. Where to begin, where to begin?
Well, since I have very little (read: fuckin nothin) experience with Perl, I guess I'm going to have to delineate my ideas for Everything Development as closely as I can. That means that any text that follows  might be long-winded and irritating.&lt;p&gt;

Before I begin, though, I'd like to say that my standpoint on how everything should be developed stems from two things: a) usefulness to the people of E2, and b) usefulness of the Everything Engine in a business paradigm; that is to say, perhaps for use on a company intranet, or something similar. In fact, the &quot;intranet&quot; idea has always been been the basis of most my small/large ideas. I'll get to that later.
