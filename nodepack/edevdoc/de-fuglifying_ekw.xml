  <doctext>Alright, so the patches i submitted didn't work. &lt;br&gt;
Here's what I was trying to do (for now). I was putting code in that would allow the user to chose which two colours ENN/newnodes showed. The problem with this being that cool writeups, and pretty much anything with the gradient is still ugly. &lt;Br&gt;
Here's how one (not me) could fix it: have a second set of link colours for on top of the gradient. &lt;Br&gt;
I have no idea how hard this would be.&lt;br&gt;
