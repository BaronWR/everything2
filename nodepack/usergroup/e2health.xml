  <doctext>Everything2 is like a Gold's Gym for the mind. People stand around, exercising their mental muscles while often forgetting that the brain is attached to that other thing: the body. I'm not saying we should all unplug our computers and go out and purchase cross trainer tennis shoes and a Bowflex, but it would be nice to have a place within e2 where people can discuss general health topics. If
you have a question about the proper maintenance of a vegetarian diet, then e2health is where you should turn. If you have found some interesting information about the side effects from a common over-the-counter allergy drug, then we in e2health would like to hear about it. If you want to know about experiences other noders have had with a certain brand of contact lens cleaning solution, you've found the right place to ask. If you want to discuss the season-premier final episode of Buffy the Survivor Battle of the Sexes Boot Camp Challenge Loves Raymond... e2health is probably not that place. Enjoy and be healthy!
