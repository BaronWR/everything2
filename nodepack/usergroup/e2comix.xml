  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;The scope of the [e2comix] group includes [comic book]s of all types: [superhero] yarns, the [comix|underground press], Japanese [manga], and many others. Its members discuss comics both new and old, clue each other in on the latest developments in the industry, announce new comics-related nodes they've created, provide feedback on said nodes, make dumb jokes and generally geek out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group members can list any back issues they have available for trade in the collaborative node [Bartertown].&lt;/p&gt;
