&lt;p&gt;This is a group of noders who have sincerely and publicly declared that they are [Christian]. This is to say that &lt;strong&gt;according to their own lights and the teachings of their church, they have placed their [faith] in [Jesus Christ] as [Lord] and [Savior].&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

[%
return '&lt;p&gt;If you\'re currently keeping your [light] under a bushel for whatever reason, know that if you decide to come out, we\'ve got your back.&lt;/p&gt;'

&lt;p&gt;This may mean something very different to you than it does to them. You may even consider their church's [doctrine]s to be so out of true with [scripture] (or [tradition] or [reason] or prophetic [revelation]) that you feel they shouldn't properly be called &quot;Christians&quot; at all. [It's just a node. It's not the freakin' Council of Nicaea.|This is fine.] Regarding our differences in belief and practice it's as [John Wesley] said in his sermon &lt;em&gt;The Catholic Spirit&lt;/em&gt;: &quot;We will talk of them, if need be, at a more convenient season.&quot;  The only grounds for asking that someone be removed from this list is if you have [substantial] proof that their public profession of faith was somehow [theonomist|insincere].&lt;/p&gt;
