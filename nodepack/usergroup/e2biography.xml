A band of noders dedicated to setting the standards for biographies on E2, both through their writing, and their [blab!|constructive criticism] of others' work. 
&lt;p&gt;
Suggested reading for all might begin with [E2 FAQ: writing a biography]. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The [The Biog List|Biog List] exists for the purpose of keeping track of things. Questions and requests to shimmer, please.
