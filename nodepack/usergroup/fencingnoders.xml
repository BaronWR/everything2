  <doctext>*** [simonc] has quit IRC (Quit: fencingnoders are the deadliest sect on E2. Rar!)
&lt;p&gt;
So we're here, we've got [weapons], and we're not afraid to slap you across the face and make you cry for mommy. But we also like to talk to other [fencers], hence this handy dandy usergroup for sending out messages to other [fencing] noders. Hopefully this will create some good discussion, and also maybe set up an [impromptu] fencing duel in YOUR neck of the woods.
&lt;p&gt;
Be afraid. Be very afraid.
