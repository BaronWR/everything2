The [e2lefties] usergroup has been set up as a
group for noders actively interested in [left-wing]
political thought, discussion and activities.

&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;b&gt;FAQ&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;

Q:  Do I have to do anything?
&lt;br /&gt;
A: Well, the [idea] at the moment is to make use of
[Political Asylum] to stage debates with those in
[FreedomForum] who want to participate (or anyone else
who's up for a good argument). Although we realise
that we are unlikely to resolve any issues (the
[greatest political minds of the twentieth century]
couldn't conclusively achieve this), we hope that on
each issue discussed, two convincing sides will be
developed. These can then be [written up] by a
representative of each group and posted on a
collaborative node.

&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;

Q: What if I don't want to debate?
&lt;br /&gt;
A: You can still contribute to the group by raising
issues, or [notify]ing us of events (protests
perhaps?) or just [sit and watch]. We&#146;re still new, so
once we work out exactly what we&#146;re doing, there&#146;ll be
something more useful here. You can also contribute to the group's shared document, &quot;&lt;b&gt;[What's Left?]&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;

Q: Do I have to address other group members as
&quot;[comrade]&quot; or &quot;comrade editor/god&quot;?
&lt;br /&gt;
A: No, not unless you really feel the need to.
