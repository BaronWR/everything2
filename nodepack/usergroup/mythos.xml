  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;What yesterday was [religion], today is [myth]. What today is [folklore] may be tomorrow's religion. [Superstition] travels in both directions, and there is truth in all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group for users who node mythology, folklore and related projects, particularly material listed in the [Mythos] set of nodes. Given the nature of the subject, we might have some overlap with the [e2religion] group so keep them in mind if you work with traditions that are also &quot;live&quot; religions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new group is ideal for cross-culture generalists but specialists on any particular tradition are welcome to join and contribute their expertise and experience.&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>
