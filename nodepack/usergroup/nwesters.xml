  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;NWesters includes noders from the region sometimes known as [Cascadia]. Although we are not necessarily a radical secessionist group, we also don't think it's a totally terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NWesters like to play in the rain and take naps and mostly do normal human things. It helps lull the rest of the world into a false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/msg [ideath] if you would like to be considered for membership. It doesn't cost much (considering the benefits) and hardly hurts at all.&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>
