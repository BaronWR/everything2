Welcome to E2Pagans, a small grove in the E2 universe.  It's a place to discuss, contrast and compare, learn, and document
Paganism in all its myriad forms.  We'll talk about things such as neopaganism, Wicca, Asatru, spirituality, Druidism, Feraferia,
and anything else Pagan-related that members can think of.  We'll learn about each other and our religious practices.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A definition of Paganism can be elusive, but for our purposes we might turn to Isaac Bonewits: &quot;To most of us, Paganism is a
general term for polytheistic religions old and new...&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everyone is welcome to join with us and explore the world of Paganism. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
