  <doctext>This usergroup is for technical discussion of weapon delivery systems, intended as a companion for [e2armory]. Got a question, or need advice for a military-themed writeup? Perhaps you need help identifying a specific piece of hardware or are looking for some background information. Anything from bombers to boomers can be discussed here, but please leave politics at the door.
