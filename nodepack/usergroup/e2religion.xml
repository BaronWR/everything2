  <doctext>This usergroup is for anyone interested in the discussion and documentation of
religious topics on e2. If you'd like to join, drop [Tiefling] a line.&lt;br&gt;

[usergroup message archive|Archived messages]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The following are &lt;em&gt;guidelines&lt;/em&gt; for the
religion group's field of enquiry, discussion and noding:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[World religion]s past and present, [theistic religion|theistic] and
[ethical religion|ethical]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theology of all kinds, including the theological perspectives of group
members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The history of religion, and key figures within it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The future of religion, and current affairs in the religious sphere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beliefs and practices such as [atheism], [agnosticism] and [humanism]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cults, sects, denominations, fellowships and other religious
collectives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religious texts and writings, including the possibility of creating one or
more shared accounts to node material of this nature which is outside
copyright&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
These are, of course, only guidelines. Two things we'd like to rule &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; from the group's intended activities, however, are prosyletising, and participating in the [Getting to Know You|GTKY]-style 'debate' nodes on topics such as [creationism]. Obviously nobody is going to appear with a big stick and hit any member who does write such a WU, but it's the small area of religion it might be wisest to leave be.
