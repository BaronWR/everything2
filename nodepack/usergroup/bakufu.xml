  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;This usergroup is for noders familiar with [Japanese] language and culture. Here in their little [zen garden] they shall meditate on the great questions of noding things Japanese on E2. Anything you send to them will come back smaller, better and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bakufu usergroup is charged by the [e2gods|powers that be] with hammering out sticky issues regarding the usage of Japanese on everything2. The group publishes current standards in the [E2 Japanese Conventions] node.

&lt;p&gt;Please contact the honourable [sekicho] if you wish to become a member of this group.&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>
