&lt;p&gt;VideoGames is the corner of Everything2 where we node about and
discuss the world of [video games] - everything from [video
games|the games themselves] to [Video Games Platforms|the
technology behind them] to [Video Games Characters|the
characters depicted within them].  There's also a lot of
discussion in the group, but moreso about news in the industry
and not so much about &quot;How do I beat the Silver Flame Dragon at
the end of the Space Zone?&quot;.  Consider joining us if you want to
talk games, [E2 FAQ: Video Games|node games], or just [*ify!
FAQ|be alerted] whenever a new game-related writeup hits E2.&lt;/p&gt;
