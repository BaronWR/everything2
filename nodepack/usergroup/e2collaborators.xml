  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;[a few days ago|Once upon a time], in a [on my computer in Missouri|far
off land], after an intense discussion [google talk|in the throne room of
Castle Artman] the idea for a new e2 usergroup was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK enough silliness. To put it simply I've been wanting to do a
[Story-Go-Round] on E2 for years but how to manage that has always been a
[conundrum] to me. Recently the solution dawned on me as I was having a
three-way... email conversation... with [Jet-Poop|Mr. Poop] and
[Junkill|Junky] trying to get an idea going for a collaboration. I thought,
why not a new E2 group to kick around ideas with? Why stop at only one
Story-Go-Round (which in this case would be a node with many writeups, each
continuing the story).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is. &lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;e2collaborators&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;e2collaborators can collaborate using the collaboration node [Collaboration #1]&lt;/p&gt;
