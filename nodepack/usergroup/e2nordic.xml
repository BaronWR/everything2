&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image above shows [Kalmar castle] in Sweden, site of the [1397] [summit meeting] that led&lt;br&gt;to the formation of the [Kalmar Union], the historic first union of the central Nordic states.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Everything2's Nordic usergroup: e2nordic.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;e2nordic&lt;/strong&gt; [usergroup] is a discussion group for [Nordic] noders, or noders with an interest in the Nordic countries (i.e. [Denmark], [Norway], [Sweden], [Finland], [Iceland] and smaller dependencies like the [Faeroe Islands] and the [&#197;land Islands]). The group also welcomes discussion about related or neighbouring nations (such as the [Baltic] states and [Germany]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prefer to keep discussion restricted to either the [common denominator] Nordic languages of [Danish] / [Swedish] / [Norwegian], or E2's default language, [English]. There are presently no [Finnish] or [Icelandic] usergroups, however, and we are quite [tolerance|tolerant] of discussion in those languages, as well. In fact, being Nordic, we're [forgiving|tolerant] of anyone who promises to buy us a beer at the next nodermeet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no [topic] restrictions - if you want to talk about [andersa|your latest hangover], or [Carthag|the miserable state of your love life], we'll gladly listen, with appropriate expressions of sympathy or ridicule to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an interest in the Nordic countries, and would like to join us, please contact the usergroup's founder and administrator, [liveforever].&lt;/p&gt;
