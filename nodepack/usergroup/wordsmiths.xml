Admit it.  You find [ecstacy] in the precise arrangement of letters upon a board and moan in delight when you get that [triple word score].  You get [the shakes] when you skip your daily [crossword puzzle].  You've been known to [anagram|rearrange letters] aloud in your sleep.  And as much as you deny it, you revel in the [guilty pleasure] of [bad pun|bad puns] gone wild.
&lt;p&gt;
So do yourself a favor.  Join our letter-hugging [usergroup], and be prepared for invitations to late-night games of Yahoo [Literati] full of noderful fun.
&lt;p&gt;
You know you want to.  Just message our [reviled|revered] groupleader [machfive] and say, &quot;Add my ass to the wordsmiths usergroup!&quot;</doctext>
