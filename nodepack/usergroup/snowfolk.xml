  <doctext>[Minnesota ] - where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average.
&lt;p&gt;
There has been a sad dearth of noder love in the [Twin Cities]/Minnesota area. THIS MUST BE STOPPED...err, remedied. There are toes to be warmed! Hot liquids to be consumed! Pants to be worn! The only thing you need in order to qualify is residency in Minnesota (and surrounding areas) and a parka ([snowshoes] optional).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To be added, or removed, talk to [RACECAR]. </doctext>
