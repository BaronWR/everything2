  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;This is where the German-speaking noder contingent gathers to drink [Schnaps] and plan the most efficient way to node things German on E2. Failing to do that we'll just drink more Schnaps, node Bavarian drinking songs and talk about football. Do not offend us or we'll send some [Swiss|funny-speaking people from the South] to yodel outside your window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This group plans to follow the model of the [bakufu] gang, who have been very successful at enhancing E2's Japanese content both quantitively and qualitatively,
and provide consensus and authoritative output regarding the way the language, history and rich culture of the German-speaking world--that means principally [Germany], [Austria] and part of [Switzerland]--is presented on E2.&lt;/p&gt;
