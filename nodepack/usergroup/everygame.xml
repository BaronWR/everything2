&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found (or written) a cool [video games] writeup and wished there was an easy way to find all the other games by that developer, add it to your 'wish list', find similar games, compare versions from different platforms, or add your own comments, ratings or additional information? Do you [hanker] for an accurate and comprehensive guide to games, like the ones for [All Music Guide|music] and [IMDB|movies]? Do you know about games, databases or ecore? Then you've come to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[EveryGame]&lt;/b&gt; is my proposal for an Everything-powered site to 'spin off' the video games coverage on E2. (Think [AnimeFu], but a little bit more ambitious than that...) The [EveryGame] usergroup has been set up to allow noders interested in this proposal to discuss how it can be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/msg [fondue] to join (or quit).&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>
