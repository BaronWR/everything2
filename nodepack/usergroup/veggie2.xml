  <doctext>&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Given the minor reactionary criticisms that gave the creator of the [carnivorze2] usergroup impetus to ask for that group's creation was apparently so offended (&lt;i&gt;tee hee!&lt;/i&gt;) that s/he felt the creation of that usergroup was necessary for purposes of balance. And that makes sense; every situation has to have a [veggie2|good faction] and an [carnivorze|evil faction]. We're the polar opposite of the [carnivorze2] usergroup, and we cater to [vegetarianism|vegetarians], [veganism|vegans], [fruitarian]s, and interested parties (including fence-sitting omnivores contemplating absconding from the Dark Side of the Force). Join us! You know you want to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;We have shared space at &lt;b&gt;&lt;highlight&gt;[veggie2 garden]&lt;/highlight&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, so feel free to utilize it in any veg-related way you see fit!&lt;/p&gt;
