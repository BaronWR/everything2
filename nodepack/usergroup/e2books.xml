Books! From children's classics like [Wind in the Willows] to the grown-up's [Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!] It's all here, [Far From the Madding Crowd] and [The Dark Elf Trilogy], [Snow Crash] and [Master and Commander].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If books are your thing, and you want to discuss them, share your thoughts and share in others' joy, this is the place. Feel free to tell us of interesting things you've read, or links in E2 to book reviews (whether yours or other noders'). There's an [usergroup message archive|archive] of past chatter, (in case you think you missed something) and a collaboration place ([The Book Club]). If you're interested, let [TanisNikana] or [wertperch] know, so you can be added to the roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
