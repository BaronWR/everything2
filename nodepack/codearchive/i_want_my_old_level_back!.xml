  <doctext>Since we really don't need this anymore, and it's not linked to from anywhere, we can retire the [I want my old level back!].  It has been superseded by the [Honor Roll], and is a piece of E2 history. It also references a [setting], [level weenies], which will get removed as soon as it gets faded out of getLevel.</doctext>

  <code>Many years ago, near the inception of the [Voting/Experience System], there was a time when there were
no minimum writeups required to gain levels.  Noders rose to terrific height on XP alone, using quests
and votes to skyrocket to stratospheric levels.
&lt;p&gt;When minimum writeups was finally implemented, some noders dropped levels.  Some were given the
option to get their levels back, if they wanted.
&lt;p&gt;These are those who chose to take back their old level:
&lt;p&gt;[%
  my $V = getVars(getNode('level weenies', 'setting'));
  my $str;
  my @names = keys %$V;
 @names = reverse(sort {$$V{$a} &lt;=&gt; $$V{$b}} @names);

  foreach (@names) {
    $str.=&quot;&lt;li&gt;[$_] was granted $$V{$_}\n&quot;;
 }
$str;
%]
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's going to be that much harder to gain their &lt;i&gt;next&lt;/i&gt; level, since they still have
to fill its minimum writeup requirement...
