  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;[gods|admins] have their C!s set to 0 every other day. (&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: this doesn't seem to happen to editors; sorry to pester you about this.) This happens regardless of the number of C!s the user has used. The Epicenter display shows 0 C!s, which accurately reflects the user's &lt;code&gt;$$VARS{cools}&lt;/code&gt; value of 0. Of course, this value is incorrect in the first place. Note: there are no problems of C!ing, just the display (and the information behind that) is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: it turns out it was only me. When I was working on something else, in a certain page, I made it give me 0 C!s left when I viewed it. So as soon as I viewed this page, I lost all my C!s for that day. If I didn't view that page, I had my normal C!s.&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>
