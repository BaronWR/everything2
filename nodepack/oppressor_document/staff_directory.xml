&lt;p&gt;I value my privacy, and so do many other staff members who are contributing their contact info. We're acting in good faith and believe that we can trust the current staff. I must nonetheless make the following statement to make sure that we're on the same page. Should there be unauthorised or unethical use of contact information on this page, any staff member found to be involved in its dissemination or misuse will be summarily dismissed. Not &quot;may be.&quot; Will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[Swap&lt;user&gt;|Swappian] note:&lt;/i&gt; Normally this contains personal contact info of all eds and admins, but not chanops. Scrubbed.
