  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;This page contains data that are accessible to E2 staff only and are to be treated as CONFIDENTIAL. Under no circumstances is any item of information on this page to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shared with any individual outside the E2 staff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used by anyone other than E2 staff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;used for any purpose other than communication within the context of the site's operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stored where it may be accessed by someone who is not a member of the E2 staff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I value my privacy, and so do many other staff members who are contributing their contact info. We're acting in good faith and believe that we can trust the current staff. I must nonetheless make the following statement to make sure that we're on the same page. Should there be unauthorised or unethical use of contact information on this page, any staff member found to be involved in its dissemination or misuse will be summarily dismissed. Not &quot;may be.&quot; Will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Swap's note:&lt;/i&gt; this node usually contains detailed contact info for all admins and eds (not chanops, though). Scrubbed.
