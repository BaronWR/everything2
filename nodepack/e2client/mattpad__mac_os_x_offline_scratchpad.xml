&lt;p&gt;The Mattpad is an offline scratchpad for editing writeups and other content. It runs on Mac OS X, version 10.3 and later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version is a very basic first release, with few features. All it currently supports is the editing of writeup text, which is displayed in a preview pane with HTML formatting and e2 links parsed correctly. Writeups may be saved to disk, or exported as HTML (though I'm not sure of the value of this currently). If you want to submit a writeup to E2, you need to copy and paste the writeup text. Spellchecking of the text is also supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future versions will allow you to submit writeups directly, as well as checking for valid and permitted HTML tags. I also plan to add tools to assist in the editing of the HTML and links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a work in progress, but is stable in its current form, so you are welcome to try it. Send bug reports to matt at [ascorbic] dot net. It's a bit early for feature requests, however. Let me know what you think of it though.&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>
